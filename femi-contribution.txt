THIS IS MY CONTRIBUTION

Having spent a few weeks in the DevOps Class, I have learnt the following;

1. How to install Gitbash and setup my Github account
2. How to run the Gitbash CLI for scripting and accessing servers i.e VirtualBox. Hoping to use it to access the AWS Console soon
3. How to collaborate on a project from the Github Repository.
4. Above all, I've learnt resilience when stuck, and not to be shut down when codes don't add up.
5. With these few points of mine, I hope I've been able to convince you to exit my document NOW before I upload virus to your repo.
